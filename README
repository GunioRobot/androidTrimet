androidTrimet is a Trimet client library for the Android operating system.

Purpose:
The main thing that this library buys you is not having to parse the XML
yourself and not having to figure out how to properly use AsyncTasks (or
Threads) to perform non-blocking network lookups.


Current State:
This is an alpha release of androidTrimet.  All of the functionality that is
present in Trimet's web services (http://developer.trimet.org/ws_docs/) is fully
supported, except planning a trip (which will be coming soon).

Other than Trip Planning, the peice that most needs improvement is
documentation. Here's a hint: You'll want to start with an instance of the
TrimetClient class and then call the methods on it.


Notes:
This currently requires Android 1.5+. I see no reason it couldn't be back-
ported to 1.0+ if AsyncTask was replaced with UserTask
(from http://code.google.com/p/shelves/source/browse/trunk/Shelves/src/org/curiouscreature/android/shelves/util/UserTask.java),
but I elected to standardize on 1.5 as something like 99.8% of phones are
running at least that version.

Finally, please read the LICENSE file if you would like to use this in your
software and keep in mind that this is still undergoing heavy development, so
things may change drastically.
